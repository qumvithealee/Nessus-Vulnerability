In this project, I installed and configured Nessus Essentials to perform credentialed vulnerability scans against Windows 10 Hosts. We want to capture the steps of vulnerability management function on my sandbox network: Discover, Prioritize, Assess, Report, Remediate, and Verify. Read on for the step by step guide on how you can conduct a vulnerability scan.
